Python is beloved for its readability and is a powerhouse in data science and AI. Java is a workhorse, powering massive enterprise applications. Go is modern, fast, and built for concurrency. Don't agonize over the choice. Pick one that seems interesting and learn it well. The concepts you learn will transfer.",
