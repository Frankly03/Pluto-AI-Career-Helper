  "description": "Welcome, captain of the ship. The Product Manager (PM) is the voice of the user, the strategist for the business, and the coordinator for the team. You don't manage people; you manage the product's journey from an idea to a successful reality. You operate at the intersection of Business, Technology, and User Experience (UX). This is your quest to learn how to build the right product, and build the product right.",
