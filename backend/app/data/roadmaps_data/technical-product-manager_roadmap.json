  "description": "Welcome, translator between worlds. A Technical Product Manager (TPM) is a specialized PM who focuses on the 'how' as much as the 'what' and 'why'. You own the technical foundation of a product—the APIs, the platforms, the data pipelines—that other products are built upon. You are the product manager for engineers. This is your quest to master the art of building products for a technical audience.",

While you don't need to be a senior engineer, you must be able to hold your own in a technical design discussion. A background in software engineering is the most common path to this role, but it can be learned through dedicated study.",
