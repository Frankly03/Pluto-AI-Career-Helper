  "description": "Welcome, financial detective and business navigator. A Financial Analyst, often in a role called FP&A (Financial Planning & Analysis), is the internal compass of a company. You analyze financial data to help the business make better decisions. You're not selling companies; you're helping to run one. You'll forecast revenue, manage budgets, and provide the insights that guide the company's strategy. This is your quest to become a master of corporate finance from the inside.",
