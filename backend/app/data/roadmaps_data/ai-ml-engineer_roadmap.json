  "title": "AI/ML Engineer Roadmap",
  "description": "Welcome, builder of intelligent machines. An AI/ML Engineer is a specialized software engineer who takes the models created by data scientists and makes them work in the real world. You are the bridge between theoretical research and production-grade applications. You're not just training models; you're building robust, scalable, and reliable AI systems. This is your journey to breathe life into algorithms.",
