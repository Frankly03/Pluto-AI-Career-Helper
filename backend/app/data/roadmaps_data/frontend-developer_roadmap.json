You're not making things pretty yet; you're defining the core components: this is a heading, this is a paragraph, this is an image, this is a link. Mastering HTML is about understanding how to structure content logically and semantically, which is crucial for accessibility and search engines. Itâ€™s the unglamorous but absolutely essential first step.",
