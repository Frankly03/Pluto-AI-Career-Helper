  "description": "Welcome, advocate for the user and architect of delight. A UI/UX Designer's mission is to make technology feel effortless, intuitive, and enjoyable. You are a problem-solver, a psychologist, and an artist rolled into one. You'll research user needs (UX) and then craft beautiful, functional interfaces (UI) to meet them. This is your quest to bridge the gap between humans and technology.",
