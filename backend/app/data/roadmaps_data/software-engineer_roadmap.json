  "description": "Embark on the path of the digital builder. A Software Engineer is a problem-solver who uses the principles of computer science and engineering to design, develop, test, and maintain software. This is a broader path than just web development, focusing on the fundamental principles that apply to all software, from mobile apps to operating systems. This is your journey to becoming a master craftsperson of code.",

The goal is not just to learn syntax, but to understand how programming languages work.",
