  "description": "Welcome, architect of the digital sky. A Cloud Engineer is a specialist who designs, builds, and manages an organization's cloud infrastructure. You're the one who takes the code from developers and the data from engineers and makes it run reliably and scalably on platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP. You are the master of virtualized resources, automation, and infrastructure.",
