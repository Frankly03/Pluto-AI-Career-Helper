  "description": "Welcome, animator of ideas and magician of movement. A Motion Graphics Designer takes static graphic design and brings it to life with animation, video, and sound. You create everything from slick title sequences and explainer videos to eye-catching social media ads. You blend the skills of a graphic designer with the timing of an animator. This is your quest to master the art of design in motion.",
